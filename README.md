# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

<h4>
It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.
</h4>

<p>
  The<a href= "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud">DataSet</a> contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.
This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.

It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation.
More background information about the data. Features V1, V2, â€¦ V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA, the only features which have not been transformed with PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount'. Feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. The feature 'Amount' is the transaction Amount, this feature can be used for example-dependant cost-sensitive learning. Feature 'Class' is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.

## Our Goal

<p>
- Understand the  distribution of the  data that was provided to us.
  
- Handle Imbalanced Data

- Create a 50/50 sub-dataframe ratio of "Fraud" and "Non-Fraud" transactions

- Determine the Classifiers Model we are going to use and decide which one has a higher accuracy.
  
</p>

## Requirements

- **Python Libraries**:
  - `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn` , `sklearn`
- **Kaggle API Key** (for data downloading)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   ```
2. Install Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set up your Kaggle API, download the data  and follow the steps to load
   
    - Run this command on any code editor

      
   ```
     !pip install opendatasets
   ```

   
    - Once you install library then run below command  for loading data into your editor for that you need to pass your kaggle credentials
      
   ```
       import opendatasets as od
       url = "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud/data"
       od.download(url)
   ```

## Understand the Data

<p>
  The transaction amount is relatively small. The mean of all the amounts made is approximately USD 88. There are no `Null` values, so we don't have to work on ways to replace values. Most of the transactions were Non-Fraud (99.83%) of the time, while Fraud transactions occurs (017%)of the time in the dataframe.
</p>


```
print("No Frauds" , df["Class"].value_counts()[0] / df.shape[0] *100 , "% of the datasets")
print("Frauds" , df["Class"].value_counts()[1] / df.shape[0] *100 , "% of the dataset")

```

<p>
  How imbalanced is our original dataset! Most of the transactions are non-fraud. If we use this dataframe as the base for our predictive models and analysis we might get a lot of errors and our algorithms will probably overfit since it will "assume" that most transactions are not fraud. But we don't want our model to assume, we want our model to detect patterns that give signs of fraud!
